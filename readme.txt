tkinter
math
pyperclip
mgrs
To install these libraries, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open a command prompt and enter the following commands:

pip install tkinter
pip install pyperclip
pip install mgrs
USAGE

Run the script by executing the command python MGRSCoordGenerator.py in the command prompt.

Enter the MGRS coordinate, distance (in meters), and direction (in degrees) in their respective fields.

Click on the "Calculate" button to generate a new MGRS coordinate.

The new MGRS coordinate will be displayed in the "New MGRS Coordinate" field, and it will also be copied to the clipboard.

To exit the program, close the window or press "Ctrl+C" in the command prompt.
